        <hr class="h_line">
        <p>Recently, Chef completed a course on Number Theory, now to test his Number Theory Skills. He applied for an
          online test on Number Theory, He just stuck on a problem and he needs your help. The problem is you are given
          a
          number N , you have to tell whether the number is Good or not , a number is said to be Good if square of the
          number is equal to double of the number.</p>
        <hr class="h_line" class="h_line">
        Input:<br>

        Output:<br>
        <p> If N is a Good Number print "HAPPY" (without quotes), otherwise print "NOT HAPPY" (without quotes).</p>

          The infection of virus spread till N/2 days and then after N/2 days its effects start decreasing in the same
